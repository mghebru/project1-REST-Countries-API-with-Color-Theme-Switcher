**Reflection**

One of the main challenges I faced during this project was working with API calls and making sure that country data was displayed correctly without causing errors or 
performance issues.Another challenge was managing the theme switcher functionality. Implementing light and dark modes required careful use of CSS to ensure consistent styling across 
the application. I also wanted the theme preference to persist, so I stored the selected theme in localStorage, allowing the app to remember the user’s choice even after a 
page refresh. This added a more personalized and user-friendly touch to the project. Parsing and displaying API data such as languages, currencies, and border countries was also tricky at first. The API returns complex objects, 
and accessing this information incorrectly caused errors for me. Breaking the logic into smaller helper functions made the code easier to read, debug,
and maintain.

If I were to improve this project in the future, I would also work on cleaner code organization and explore adding new features such as an interactive map to visually
display country locations. Overall, this project helped strengthen my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and working with real-world API data.
